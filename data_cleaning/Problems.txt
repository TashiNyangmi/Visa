to-do:
1) pdf file names:
	i) For now, manually rename misspelled raw_pdf file names
	ii) Can use naive ML model to auto match and rename these files
2) Inconsistent columns:
	i) try specifying col names while importing using pandas.read_csv()
	ii) Else use the build-in CSV module to read line by line
	iii) Use the file csv_clean2.py for this purpose
	iv) incorporate error handling
	v) Use OOP for this


fixed: git email
